# Burger King Website

Welcome to my first web development project - Burger King! üçî

## Overview

This project was created when I was just starting to learn web development. The website serves as a basic representation of a fictional Burger King restaurant. It's a static site built with HTML and CSS, and I want to emphasize that no JavaScript is used in this version.

## Features

- The website is built using only HTML and CSS, showcasing my early understanding of these fundamental web technologies.
  
- No media queries are included, so it may not be fully responsive.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Usage

You can also clone the repository to use it.
